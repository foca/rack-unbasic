= Rack::Unbasic

Wraps HTTP authentication in more friendly workflows.

== Usage

    require "rack-unbasic"

    use Rack::Unbasic do |on|
      on.bad_request '/login'
      on.unauthorized '/login'
    end

A response with a 401 or 400 status code will be redirected to the routes you
specify in the config, with the <tt>\env['rack-unbasic.code']</tt> set to whatever
the original status code was, and <tt>\env['rack-unbasic.return-to']</tt> set to
whatever the requested URI was.

When a request comes in with <tt>:username</tt> and <tt>:password</tt> params,
those will be mapped to basic auth credentials, and the appropriate headers will
be added.

Once authorized, the appropriate credentials will be stashed in the session.
Subsequent requests will use the credentials in the session for authorization.

== Install

    gem install rack-unbasic
